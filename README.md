🚀 About Me

I’m a Senior Python Engineer with years of experience building scalable, secure, cloud-native systems across finance, healthcare, and enterprise analytics. I specialize in backend-heavy systems, API design, data engineering, and cloud infrastructure, while also delivering polished frontend experiences when needed.

I built and scaled mission-critical platforms handling high-volume data, real-time APIs, ETL pipelines, and GenAI integrations.

I thrive in environments where performance, reliability, and clean architecture matter.

🧠 What I Do Best
🔧 Backend & API Engineering

Design and build RESTful & async APIs using FastAPI, Django, Flask

Develop secure microservices with OAuth2, JWT, LDAP

Optimize API performance using Redis caching, async I/O, and query tuning

Build event-driven systems using Redis Pub/Sub, Kafka, Kinesis

☁️ Cloud & DevOps

Architect cloud-native systems on AWS & Azure

Hands-on with EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS, RDS, S3, DynamoDB, Glue, Redshift

Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, AWS CDK, CloudFormation
