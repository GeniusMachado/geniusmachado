🚀 About Me

I’m a Senior Python Engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable, secure, cloud-native systems across finance, healthcare, and enterprise analytics. I specialize in backend-heavy systems, API design, data engineering, and cloud infrastructure, while also delivering polished frontend experiences when needed.

I’ve worked at Mass General Brigham, Fitch Ratings, American Express, UnitedHealth Group, and Barclays, where I built and scaled mission-critical platforms handling high-volume data, real-time APIs, ETL pipelines, and GenAI integrations.

I thrive in environments where performance, reliability, and clean architecture matter.

🧠 What I Do Best
🔧 Backend & API Engineering

Design and build RESTful & async APIs using FastAPI, Django, Flask

Develop secure microservices with OAuth2, JWT, LDAP

Optimize API performance using Redis caching, async I/O, and query tuning

Build event-driven systems using Redis Pub/Sub, Kafka, Kinesis

☁️ Cloud & DevOps

Architect cloud-native systems on AWS & Azure

Hands-on with EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS, RDS, S3, DynamoDB, Glue, Redshift

Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, AWS CDK, CloudFormation

Containerization with Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes (EKS, Helm)

CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, SonarQube

📊 Data Engineering & Analytics

Build ETL pipelines using Apache Airflow, AWS Glue, Spark

Integrate batch & streaming data from Kafka, Kinesis, S3

Work extensively with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, Redshift, MongoDB

Optimize SQL for large-scale analytical workloads

🤖 GenAI & Machine Learning

Integrated OpenAI & AWS Bedrock into production systems

Built RAG pipelines using LangChain, vector databases

Enabled semantic search, document summarization, and analytics insights

Supported ML inference pipelines for risk & analytics platforms

🎨 Frontend & Visualization

Build dashboards using React.js, AngularJS, Next.js, TypeScript

Data visualizations with D3.js, Recharts, Highcharts

Full-stack delivery when required — backend first, UI always purposeful
